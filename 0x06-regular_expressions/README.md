# 0x06-regular_expressions

## In this repo I will study the regular expressions with ruby on rails.

### 0-simply_match_school - A file check a School matching regular expression.

### the other files also checks some strings matching the regular expression or not
Tip-> when there is a task that require specific string or number we have to specify the beginning and the end such as task :
1-- 5 beginning_and_end
2-- 6-phone_number

the last file/task has a good idea take a look!
